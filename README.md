# Zach's dotfiles

All the (maintained) dotfiles and configuration files for my development
environment.

- [ nvim ](https://github.com/zachy-ho/dotfiles/tree/master/nvim): Neovim
- [ kitty ](https://github.com/zachy-ho/dotfiles/tree/master/kitty): Kitty (terminal)
- [ config.conf ](https://github.com/zachy-ho/dotfiles/blob/master/config.conf): neofetch (something for fun)
- *~~alacritty.yml: alacritty~~ (Not used anymore, see Kitty instead)*
- [ .tmux.conf ](https://github.com/zachy-ho/dotfiles/blob/master/.tmux.conf): tmux

Note for Neovim:
- Stable build is managed by Brew. Nightly build self-managed.
  - Neovim git repo (for nightly build) should be under '~/neovim'. Refer to neovim GitHub page for
    installation, uninstall and updating references.
